OpenAI looks across US for sites to build its Trump-backed Stargate AI data centers
By Matt O’Brien
OpenAI is scouring the U.S. for sites to build a network of huge data centers to power its artificial intelligence technology, expanding beyond a flagship Texas location and looking across 16 states to accelerate the Stargate project championed by President Donald Trump.

The maker of ChatGPT put out a request for proposals for land, electricity, engineers and architects and began visiting locations in Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this week.

Trump touted Stargate, a newly formed joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank, shortly after returning to the White House last month. The partnership said it is investing $100 billion — and eventually up to $500 billion — to build large-scale data centers and the energy generation needed to further AI development. Trump called the project a “resounding declaration of confidence in America’s potential” under his new administration, though the first project in Abilene, Texas, has been under construction for months.

Elon Musk, a Trump adviser and fierce rival of OpenAI who is in a legal fight with the company and its CEO Sam Altman, has publicly questioned the value of Stargate's investments.

After Trump's announcement, a number of states reached out to OpenAI about welcoming additional data centers, Chris Lehane, OpenAI's vice president of global affairs, told reporters Thursday.

The company's request for proposals calls for sites with “proximity to necessary infrastructure including power and water.” AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Data centers also typically draw in large amounts of water for cooling. Some tech giants have started financing nuclear power to plug into their data centers.

OpenAI's proposal makes no mention of whether it intends to prioritize renewable energy sources such as wind or solar to power the data centers. But it says electricity providers should have a plan to manage carbon emissions and water usage.

“There’s some sites we’re looking at where we want to help be part of the process that brings new power to that site, either from new gas deployment or other means,” said Keith Heyde, who directs OpenAI’s infrastructure strategy.

The first Texas project is in a region Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt has described to The Associated Press as rich in multiple energy sources, including wind, solar and gas. Also describing it that way is the company that began building the AI data center campus there in June — the same two “big, beautiful buildings” that Altman showed off in a recent drone video posted on social media.

Crusoe CEO Chase Lochmiller said that wind power is central to the project his company is building, though it will also have a gas-fired generator for backup power.

“We try to build data centers in locations where we can access low-cost, clean and abundant energy resources,” Lochmiller said. “West Texas really fits that mold where it's one of the most consistently windy and sunny places in the United States.”

Lochmiller said he expects the Trump administration, despite the president's opposition to wind farms, to be pragmatic in supporting wind-powered data centers when it is “actually the cheapest way to access energy."

Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that’s expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

The other states where OpenAI is actively looking include Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Utah, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. Heyde said the company only plans to build “somewhere between five to ten” campuses in total, depending on how large each one is.

OpenAI previously relied on business partner Microsoft for its computing needs. But the two companies recently amended their partnership to enable OpenAI to pursue data center development on its own.

<h2><strong>Is DeepSeek really better for the environment than ChatGPT and Gemini?</strong></h2>
<strong>By Matthew Rozsa</strong><br>
<br>
When Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng revealed DeepSeek’s newest app to the world earlier this month, most people had never even heard of the artificial intelligence company. But the new app took the world by storm, as many in the tech community marveled at how DeepSeek functioned at a fraction of the cost of other large language models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. That’s presumably good news for the environment, as many have criticized the AI craze as being extremely taxing on electrical grids — so much so that some tech companies like Google and Meta have reopened coal plants.<br>
<br>
In theory, any AI alternative that consumes fewer resources should be better for the environment. Yet experts weighing in on the potential promise in DeepSeek’s “Sputnik” moment (to quote billionaire software developer Marc Andreessen) expressed cautious optimism.<br>
<br>
“There is almost no information available about either ChatGPT or DeepSeek, so any numbers [about their environmental impact] are speculation,” David Rolnick, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University, said. “It's unlikely that there is a massive difference between these two algorithms, but it's hard to say the biggest differences in terms of the energy consumption aspects of large AI algorithms are how much you use.”<br>
<br>
That said, DeepSeek could still represent a step in the right direction, at least in terms of sustainability. Climate scientists are rightfully worried about the huge energy drain from data centers in the U.S., which is expected to either double or triple by 2028. Rolnick explained that the environmental impacts of very large AI models include the energy use associated with developing training and querying them, water usage for cooling data centers and impacts associated with manufacturing hardware like servers and chips.<br>
<br>
Yet Rahul Sandhil, the vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at the semiconductor company MediaTek, told the Associated Press that DeepSeek offers hope for reducing those impacts. It is known as an “open-weight” model, which means it can be downloaded and run locally, assuming one has sufficient hardware. If their claims hold up, some routine AI queries in the future may not need data centers at all and could instead be shifted to phones. The fact that the LLM is open source is another plus for the DeepSeek model, which has wiped out at least $1.2 trillion in stock market value. Meanwhile, companies like OpenAI, which have been operating for a decade, have yet to be profitable.<br>
<br>
What it ultimately comes down to is whether people actually use it over other models. It doesn’t matter if it’s “better” for the environment if it doesn’t see much adoption. Additionally, as Prof. Anthony Cohn at the University of Leeds and Foundation Models Lead at the Alan Turing Institute said in a statement, “the DeepSeek models are still language only, rather than multi-modal – they cannot take speech, image or video inputs, or generate them. No doubt the future will see such a release, though the computational demands of handling multi-modal data are much greater than when just handling language.”<br>
<br>
That could explain its seemingly lesser impact on the planet. On a financial level, how DeepSeek functions with fewer resources will raise unavoidable sustainability questions when other AI companies attempt to succeed using more consumptive models.<br>
<br>
“The DeepSeek announcement should prompt regulators all across the country to feel empowered to rigorously interrogate forecasts used to justify lock-in of fossil fuel infrastructure,” according to Julie McNamara, deputy policy director with the Climate &amp; Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. In contrast to claims that AI demands massive investments of money and electricity — often hand-waved away as a “trade off” for the bright future this tech will allegedly usher in — policymakers and investors should instead acknowledge that AI could be effectively developed without a catastrophic carbon footprint.<br>
<br>
“There is no question that electricity demand will be ratcheting up over the years and decades to come, regardless of data center needs,” McNamara said. “But this is a transition that must be approached with a necessarily long view, built on strong foundations that ensure the needs of the public are elevated throughout.”<br>
<br>
Additionally, policymakers and investors should also ask which AI programs are truly necessary. If many routine AI functions can be performed without massive data centers, then limiting AI use to situations when it is necessary and irreplaceable could at least somewhat mitigate its environmental harms.<br>
<br>
“Fundamentally, society has to decide how much you want to use an immense generative AI algorithm, and I think that as a whole, we haven't yet worked out whether they are useful in the vast majority of cases in which they're being used,” Rolnick said. People can often perform Google searches or ask humans to perform tasks that AI business leaders argue should be outsourced to AI.<br>
<br>
“It is unclear to me that the vast majority of uses of algorithms like DeepSeek and ChatGPT are providing benefits in many places,” Rolnick said. “If we are to think about environmental benefits associated with one model or another, these will pale in comparison to the decision whether or not to use such AI algorithms as compared either with non-AI approaches.”<br>
<br>
McNamara acknowledges that — with the fossil fuel industry’s political allies in control of the presidency, legislature and courts — this will not be easy.<br>
<br>
“Recently, the massive energy requirements associated with AI development have been invoked to justify the build-out of scores of new gas-fired power plants,” McNamara said. “But such a turn is entirely out of step with the true needs of a forward-looking economy.” That is why, above all else, the unveiling of DeepSeek is relevant for inhabitants of Earth as an opportunity to challenge narratives about humanity’s use of fossil fuels.<br>
<br>
“Fossil fuel companies are seizing this moment to attempt a blatant end-run around critical climate and public health standards to lock-in new gas infrastructure for decades to come,” McNamara said.

<h2><strong>Trump says immigration authorities can arrest people at churches and schools</strong></h2>
<strong>Author: Not listed</strong><br />
<br />
U.S. immigration authorities will be able to arrest migrants at schools, churches and hospitals after the Trump administration overturned policies banning immigration enforcement from so-called &ldquo;sensitive areas&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection had been restricted from doing so for more than a decade. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, said in a statement: &ldquo;Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America&rsquo;s schools and churches to avoid arrest.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,&rdquo; the statement said.<br />
<br />
The directive was one of two issued from Benjamine Huffman, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.<br />
<br />
The second directive reinstates with immediate effect so-called &ldquo;expedited removal&rdquo; nationwide. Under this authority, U.S. ICE can quickly deport any undocumented person arrested inside the country who can&rsquo;t prove they have been here continuously for more than two years.<br />
<br />
The changes come as Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration executes a major crackdown on immigration in the U.S. The president signed a slew of executive actions that included cutting off access to an app that facilitated the entry of hundreds of thousands of people as well as suspending the refugee system and promoting greater cooperation between ICE and local and state governments.<br />
<br />
Administration officials vowed to immediately begin rounding up people in the U.S. illegally, as part of the president&rsquo;s promise to carry out &ldquo;mass deportations&rdquo;. Trump&rsquo;s border czar, Tom Homan, said in an interview that immigration agents would fan out across the United States to arrest and deport undocumented people.<br />
<br />
He did not say where the raids would take place.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to do it throughout the country. We have offices throughout the country, and every ICE officer is going to be out there and enforce the law starting tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Homan said.<br />
<br />
Advocates warned that the Trump administration&rsquo;s move to allow arrests at sensitive locations would have harmful effects.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;This action could have devastating consequences for immigrant families and their children, including U.S. citizen children, deterring them from receiving medical attention, seeking out disaster relief, attending school, and carrying out everyday activities,&rdquo; the Center for Law and Social Policy said in a statement.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Should ICE presence near such locations become more common, the likelihood also increases that children could witness a parent&rsquo;s detention, arrest, or other encounters with ICE agents,&rdquo; the organization said.<br />
<br />
During an inaugural prayer service sermon, the Episcopal bishop of Washington appealed directly to Trump to &ldquo;have mercy upon&rdquo; immigrants and LGBTQ+ people.

<h2><strong>Trump administration creates registry for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally</strong></h2>
<strong>By Rebecca Santana</strong><br />
<br />
The Trump administration is creating a registry for all people who are in the United States illegally, and those who don&#39;t self-report could face fines or prosecution, immigration officials announced.<br />
<br />
Everyone who is in the U.S. illegally must register, give fingerprints and provide an address, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. It cited a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act &mdash; the complex immigration law &mdash; as justification for the registration process, which would apply to anyone 14 and older.<br />
<br />
The announcement comes as the administration seeks to make good on campaign promises to carry out mass deportations of people in the country illegally and seal the border to future asylum-seekers.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;An alien&rsquo;s failure to register is a crime that could result in a fine, imprisonment, or both,&quot; the statement said. &quot;For decades, this law has been ignored &mdash; not anymore.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
On its website, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service said it would soon create a form and process for registration.<br />
<br />
In one of his 10 inauguration day executive orders related to immigration, President Donald Trump initially outlined plans for creating a registry and required that Homeland Security &ldquo;immediately announce and publicize information about the legal obligation of all previously unregistered aliens in the United States to comply.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was not immediately clear how many people living in the country illegally would voluntarily come forward and give the federal government information about who they are and where they&#39;re living. But failure to register would be considered a crime, and the administration has said its initial priority target for deportation is people who&#39;ve committed crimes in the U.S.<br />
<br />
The National Immigration Law Center, an immigration advocacy group, said in a posting on its website before the announcement that &ldquo;the Alien Registration Act of 1940 is the only time the U.S. government carried out a comprehensive campaign to require all noncitizens to register.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The organization said under that process, people had to go to their local post office to register, and the goal was to identify &ldquo;potential national security threats broadly characterized as communist or subversive.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The group warned that the registry was meant to help find potential targets for deportation. &ldquo;Any attempt by the Trump administration to create a registration process for noncitizens previously unable to register would be used to identify and target people for detention and deportation,&rdquo; the organization said.
