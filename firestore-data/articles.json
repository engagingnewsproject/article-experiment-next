    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-throws.webp\" caption=\"FILE - Transgenders rights supporters rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.\"]\nThe Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.\n\nBut the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

It has nothing whatsoever to do with any of the arguments being supplied. It is 100% about gender, and people's obsession with forcing people into gender roles based on whether they were born with or without a Y chromosome. It's all part of the patronizing view that anyone born with a Y chromosome is a threat to anyone born without one, and the latter MUST be protected from the former at all costs to fairness and equality.Don't believe me? Then why are 99.99999% of these very emotional arguments about \"protecting our daughters\" from trans women, \"men in women's bathrooms and lockers and sports\"-- virtually NEVER about trans men or women in men's locker rooms, etc.It's not about equality or fairness; it's about the prejudiced and stereotypical view that ALL men are threats to ALL women and must not be allowed to even exist in certain places, while virtually no attention is paid to the reverse.",

His problems in life are not anyone else's problems to pay for.But no child should ever have the decision made for them to permanently or temporarily alter they bodies. When they become adults, they can make that decision for themselves. On their own dime.",

Secondly, the SCOTUS protected children from activist parents and others who push the trans agenda on children. These rulings are IN FAVOR of children not against trans. For whatever reason, the media has an agenda to try and transform children. When someone has a mental disorder, gender dysphoria, you don't indulge the disorder, you try to get the individual afflicted to accept reality. When someone is anorexic and delusional believes they are overweight, the treatment isn't to affirm their delusion of being overweight. Somehow, activists with the help of the media, have adopted the misnomer \"gender affirming care\" into the lexicon but it is just another example of up means down.",

Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

This is really just another step towards the dismantling of our democracy. First you break the law but tell everyone it is only the illegal criminals you are doing this to. But once you can break the law with impunity you can then start locking up others. It’s telling they used the Alien and Seditions act to do this. We all should have learned that this was an unconstitutional law when it first came out in 1789, which is why it was never used. Did you know this same law prevents criticizing the government as well? That’s where we are all heading and by the time you figure it out it will be too late.",

    "summary": "The comments present a broad range of perspectives regarding immigration enforcement, particularly the actions of volunteers who warn undocumented immigrants of ICE operations. A majority of commentators express strong support for strict immigration control, advocating for the arrest and prosecution of those perceived to be aiding undocumented immigrants by warning them of ICE activities, viewing this as criminal conduct tantamount to obstruction of justice. Conversely, a minority of commenters argue for the compassion and rights of immigrants, suggesting that aiding those seeking better lives shouldn't be criminalized and is akin to exercising free speech.

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Volunteers-use-bullhorns.webp\" caption=\"Ron Gochez, a teacher volunteering with Union del Barrio, an organization advocating for immigrant rights, is reflected in a side mirror as he searches for ICE activity in a neighborhood in Los Angeles.\"]\nJust before dawn, 10 people met at a parking lot shared by a laundromat and coffee shop in South Central Los Angeles on what has become a daily mission: Look for immigration officers and warn people of their presence to try to prevent arrests. Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-throws.webp\" caption=\"FILE - Transgenders rights supporters rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.\"]\nThe Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.\n\nBut the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

I felt like throwing up all day picturing that. I can only imagine the fear and pain and horror these poor girls went through, even though it was culturally accepted. Although I'm sure that our doctors' use anesthesia and a scalpel in a clean hospital room, I view any procedure on children to change their natural anatomy, whether by chemical or scalpel, to be just as abusive. Children trust the adults around them naturally, and it's very easy to talk them into thinking something is \"normal\" when it's not. However anyone tries to justify it, this is child abuse. There are other ways to treat gender disphoria, if that is truly what they have, and they haven't been manipulated by the people around them. And if they still feel that way as an adult, then they are free to change their body any way they want, but not on my dime, thank you.",

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

The ONLY concern I had when sharing a foxhole was not if the guy beside me was gay or not but whether or not he was a good shot. I still feel the same way today 50 some years later. If a person in the US military has shown the ability to do the job he/she was trained for it's absolutely ludicrous to force that person out. A lot of money was spent to train that individual and it's irrelevant what sexuality he/she is or identifies as and should not be a concern. People have been gay for thousands of years.

The Pentagon’s own data shows trans service members perform just as well as anyone else, and a 2016 Rand study confirmed they have no measurable impact on unit cohesion, readiness, or cost. Former Joint Chiefs chair Gen. Dunford and even Trump’s own Defense Secretary James Mattis admitted there was no military reason for a ban. So this isn’t about national security—it’s about turning America’s armed forces into a bigoted clubhouse for Tucker fanboys.

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

Immoral lifestyle choices overlooked in civilian society such as adultery, prostitution or lying are grounds for dismissal from the military. The military has a job and people's personal preferences are not the determining factor in service. So called transgender persons - are part of a radical philosophy which places their personal goals above military service. The demand benefits other service members cannot get (plastic surgery/hormone treatment to change body characteristics). They place an unfair cost on medical treatment needed by all military personnel. They may live their beliefs but they immoral, unscientific beliefs should not override the military's mission of protecting our nation. US Army - SFC - 4 combat tours - retired opinion.",

The majority voice emphasizes the humanitarian aspect, advocating for compassion towards migrants and stressing the need for due process and acknowledgment of their difficult circumstances. In contrast, the minority of commenters argue that illegal immigration should not be tolerated, asserting that individuals who enter the U.S. unlawfully should face deportation and highlighting concerns about their impact on American resources.

Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

The majority of commenters argue that illegal immigration should not be tolerated, asserting that individuals who enter the U.S. unlawfully should face deportation and highlighting concerns about their impact on American resources. In contrast, the minority voice emphasizes the humanitarian aspect, advocating for compassion towards migrants and stressing the need for due process and acknowledgment of their difficult circumstances.",

Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

But once you can break the law with impunity you can then start locking up others. It’s telling they used the Alien and Seditions act to do this. We all should have learned that this was an unconstitutional law when it first came out in 1789, which is why it was never used.

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

That’s not meritocracy, that’s cosplay authoritarianism with a flag pin. The Pentagon’s own data shows trans service members perform just as well as anyone else, and a 2016 Rand study confirmed they have no measurable impact on unit cohesion, readiness, or cost. Former Joint Chiefs chair Gen. Dunford and even Trump’s own Defense Secretary James Mattis admitted there was no military reason for a ban. So this isn’t about national security—it’s about turning America’s armed forces into a bigoted clubhouse for Tucker fanboys. At this point, they’d rather lose wars than share a barracks with someone who doesn’t conform to their 1950s gender fantasy.",

Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

    "content": "<p>Samantha Ripple was tattooed with a single word—“JUSTICE”—as she marched with about 500 people through the streets of Indianapolis on Saturday in the latest Women’s March to demand reproductive rights and access to safe, legal abortions.</p>         <p>“I came out because reproductive rights are human rights,” said Ripple, 22.</p>         <p>Ripple was one of the three demonstrators charged with disturbing the peace, Indianapolis police said. They were accused of violating a city noise ordinance by using megaphones without a permit. Also charged were Michelle Johnson, 72, and Suzann Brown, 45.</p>         <p>“We have to make our voices heard,” said Johnson, “The Supreme Court is trying to control our bodies, which violates our constitutional rights.”</p>         <p>The march is one of thousands of demonstrations that have swept the nation after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected a constitutional right to abortion since 1973. These marches are part of a groundswell of grassroots activism fighting for reproductive rights and asking for states to protect access to abortion.</p>         <p>After the Court decision, a number of Republican-led states, mostly in the South and Midwest, implemented laws banning or restricting abortions, while many Democrat-led states have moved forward with measures to protect abortion access. According to the White House, almost 30 million women of reproductive age live in states with an ongoing abortion ban.</p>         <p>Johnson recalled that before Roe v. Wade, her close friend nearly bled to death in a sorority house because she was afraid she could get arrested if she sought an illegal abortion.</p>         <p>“I am marching for my friends and others like her,” Johnson said.</p>         <p>Brown said she has marched in a half dozen rallies for abortion rights since Roe was overturned. She became pregnant at age 15. “I agonized about whether to have an abortion,” said Brown, who ultimately put her baby up for adoption. “I’m marching because I can’t imagine not having a choice at that time.”</p>         <p>“Everybody has the right to their own body,” Brown said. “It’s not up to anyone else.”</p>",

    "summary": "",
    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigrants-disappear-from.webp\" caption=\"This undated photo provided by Johanny Sanchez shows Sanchez, right, and her husband Franco Caraballo, who was sent over the weekend to El Salvador accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\"]\nFranco Caraballo called his wife Friday night, crying and panicked. Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-throws.webp\" caption=\"FILE - Transgenders rights supporters rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.\"]\nThe Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.\n\nBut the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-throws.webp\" caption=\"FILE - Transgenders rights supporters rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.\"]\nThe Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.\n\nBut the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

I felt like throwing up all day picturing that. I can only imagine the fear and pain and horror these poor girls went through, even though it was culturally accepted. Although I'm sure that our doctors' use anesthesia and a scalpel in a clean hospital room, I view any procedure on children to change their natural anatomy, whether by chemical or scalpel, to be just as abusive. Children trust the adults around them naturally, and it's very easy to talk them into thinking something is \"normal\" when it's not. However anyone tries to justify it, this is child abuse. There are other ways to treat gender disphoria, if that is truly what they have, and they haven't been manipulated by the people around them. And if they still feel that way as an adult, then they are free to change their body any way they want, but not on my dime, thank you.",

It has nothing whatsoever to do with any of the arguments being supplied. It is 100% about gender, and people's obsession with forcing people into gender roles based on whether they were born with or without a Y chromosome. It's all part of the patronizing view that anyone born with a Y chromosome is a threat to anyone born without one, and the latter MUST be protected from the former at all costs to fairness and equality.Don't believe me? Then why are 99.99999% of these very emotional arguments about \"protecting our daughters\" from trans women, \"men in women's bathrooms and lockers and sports\"-- virtually NEVER about trans men or women in men's locker rooms, etc.It's not about equality or fairness; it's about the prejudiced and stereotypical view that ALL men are threats to ALL women and must not be allowed to even exist in certain places, while virtually no attention is paid to the reverse.",

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

If a person in the US military has shown the ability to do the job he/she was trained for it's absolutely ludicrous to force that person out.

That’s not meritocracy, that’s cosplay authoritarianism with a flag pin. The Pentagon’s own data shows trans service members perform just as well as anyone else, and a 2016 Rand study confirmed they have no measurable impact on unit cohesion, readiness, or cost. Former Joint Chiefs chair Gen. Dunford and even Trump’s own Defense Secretary James Mattis admitted there was no military reason for a ban. So this isn’t about national security—it’s about turning America’s armed forces into a bigoted clubhouse for Tucker fanboys. At this point, they’d rather lose wars than share a barracks with someone who doesn’t conform to their 1950s gender fantasy.",

Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

If a person in the US military has shown the ability to do the job he/she was trained for it's absolutely ludicrous to force that person out. A lot of money was spent to train that individual and it's irrelevant what sexuality he/she is or identifies as and should not be a concern. People have been gay for thousands of years.

That’s not meritocracy, that’s cosplay authoritarianism with a flag pin. The Pentagon’s own data shows trans service members perform just as well as anyone else, and a 2016 Rand study confirmed they have no measurable impact on unit cohesion, readiness, or cost. Former Joint Chiefs chair Gen. Dunford and even Trump’s own Defense Secretary James Mattis admitted there was no military reason for a ban. So this isn’t about national security—it’s about turning America’s armed forces into a bigoted clubhouse for Tucker fanboys. At this point, they’d rather lose wars than share a barracks with someone who doesn’t conform to their 1950s gender fantasy.",

    "title": "Volunteers use bullhorns and sirens to warn immigrants when ICE is in their area",
    "summary": "The comments present a broad range of perspectives regarding immigration enforcement, particularly the actions of volunteers who warn undocumented immigrants of ICE operations. A majority of commenters argue for the compassion and rights of immigrants, suggesting that aiding those seeking better lives shouldn't be criminalized and is akin to exercising free speech. Conversely, a minority of commentators express strong support for strict immigration control, advocating for the arrest and prosecution of those perceived to be aiding undocumented immigrants by warning them of ICE activities, viewing this as criminal conduct tantamount to obstruction of justice.

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

What they are doing is otherwise protected, and no different than drivers flashing their headlights to warn others of speed traps - something the Supreme Court found to be protected under the First Amendment. THAT SAID, it is becoming clearer every day that the illegals know they have broken the law and have no intention of leaving, just as an invading army has no intention of leaving, or as the \"underground\" and \"resistance\" operated during WWII. ICE and CBP need to employ \"urban warfare\" tactics i these areas. A good \"fight fire with fire\" move might be to flood the area with dummy vehicles. which would stretch their manpower and leaving them to guess which vehicles were really manned by federal agents and which were dummies.",

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-throws.webp\" caption=\"FILE - Transgenders rights supporters rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.\"]\nThe Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.\n\nBut the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

When someone has a mental disorder, gender dysphoria, you don't indulge the disorder, you try to get the individual afflicted to accept reality. When someone is anorexic and delusional believes they are overweight, the treatment isn't to affirm their delusion of being overweight.

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigrants-disappear-from.webp\" caption=\"This undated photo provided by Johanny Sanchez shows Sanchez, right, and her husband Franco Caraballo, who was sent over the weekend to El Salvador accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\"]\nFranco Caraballo called his wife Friday night, crying and panicked. Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

The voting taxpayers are sick of these people’s behavior. They’ll claim they are all for people’s right and we should more be compassionate and turn right around and call MAGAs the worst possible names imaginable. That’s not very compassionate, that’s “you better agree with me or else.” Any of these dem supporters that think the midterms are going to produce different results are in for a shock. You people haven’t figured out why you lost in November and until you do and fix it, you’re going to keep losing.",

    "summary": "The comments present a broad range of perspectives on the issue of transgender rights and recognition. A majority of comments express anti-transgender sentiments, questioning the validity of gender identity and advocating for traditional definitions of gender. Conversely, a minority of comments express pro-transgender views, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and acceptance for transgender individuals.",

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

If a person in the US military has shown the ability to do the job he/she was trained for it's absolutely ludicrous to force that person out. A lot of money was spent to train that individual and it's irrelevant what sexuality he/she is or identifies as and should not be a concern. People have been gay for thousands of years.

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

A majority of commenters argue for the compassion and rights of immigrants, suggesting that aiding those seeking better lives shouldn't be criminalized and is akin to exercising free speech. Conversely, a minority of commentators express strong support for strict immigration control, advocating for the arrest and prosecution of those perceived to be aiding undocumented immigrants by warning them of ICE activities, viewing this as criminal conduct tantamount to obstruction of justice.

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

Now, some people (descendants of those European INVADERS) are trying to arrest and deport other INVADERS. The difference? White invaders feel we and only we have the right to determine who can live in the land we ourselves INVADED. Very, very interesting indeed. One long tragic JOKE.",

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

    "content": "[img src=\"https://mediaengagement.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Supreme-Court-throws.webp\" caption=\"FILE - Transgenders rights supporters rally outside of the Supreme Court in Washington.\"]\nThe Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.\n\nBut the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

I felt like throwing up all day picturing that. I can only imagine the fear and pain and horror these poor girls went through, even though it was culturally accepted. Although I'm sure that our doctors' use anesthesia and a scalpel in a clean hospital room, I view any procedure on children to change their natural anatomy, whether by chemical or scalpel, to be just as abusive. Children trust the adults around them naturally, and it's very easy to talk them into thinking something is \"normal\" when it's not. However anyone tries to justify it, this is child abuse. There are other ways to treat gender disphoria, if that is truly what they have, and they haven't been manipulated by the people around them. And if they still feel that way as an adult, then they are free to change their body any way they want, but not on my dime, thank you.",

It has nothing whatsoever to do with any of the arguments being supplied. It is 100% about gender, and people's obsession with forcing people into gender roles based on whether they were born with or without a Y chromosome. It's all part of the patronizing view that anyone born with a Y chromosome is a threat to anyone born without one, and the latter MUST be protected from the former at all costs to fairness and equality.Don't believe me? Then why are 99.99999% of these very emotional arguments about \"protecting our daughters\" from trans women, \"men in women's bathrooms and lockers and sports\"-- virtually NEVER about trans men or women in men's locker rooms, etc.It's not about equality or fairness; it's about the prejudiced and stereotypical view that ALL men are threats to ALL women and must not be allowed to even exist in certain places, while virtually no attention is paid to the reverse.",

The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

I felt like throwing up all day picturing that. I can only imagine the fear and pain and horror these poor girls went through, even though it was culturally accepted. Although I'm sure that our doctors' use anesthesia and a scalpel in a clean hospital room, I view any procedure on children to change their natural anatomy, whether by chemical or scalpel, to be just as abusive. Children trust the adults around them naturally, and it's very easy to talk them into thinking something is \"normal\" when it's not. However anyone tries to justify it, this is child abuse. There are other ways to treat gender disphoria, if that is truly what they have, and they haven't been manipulated by the people around them. And if they still feel that way as an adult, then they are free to change their body any way they want, but not on my dime, thank you.",

It has nothing whatsoever to do with any of the arguments being supplied. It is 100% about gender, and people's obsession with forcing people into gender roles based on whether they were born with or without a Y chromosome. It's all part of the patronizing view that anyone born with a Y chromosome is a threat to anyone born without one, and the latter MUST be protected from the former at all costs to fairness and equality.Don't believe me? Then why are 99.99999% of these very emotional arguments about \"protecting our daughters\" from trans women, \"men in women's bathrooms and lockers and sports\"-- virtually NEVER about trans men or women in men's locker rooms, etc.It's not about equality or fairness; it's about the prejudiced and stereotypical view that ALL men are threats to ALL women and must not be allowed to even exist in certain places, while virtually no attention is paid to the reverse.",

The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.\n\nThe high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.\n\nThe action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.\n\nThe rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.\n\nIn the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.\n\nThe justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia’s and North Carolina’s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.\n\nIn one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state’s ban on gender-affirming care.",

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.

The majority of commenters argue that illegal immigration should not be tolerated, asserting that individuals who enter the U.S. unlawfully should face deportation and highlighting concerns about their impact on American resources. In contrast, the minority voice emphasizes the humanitarian aspect, advocating for compassion towards migrants and stressing the need for due process and acknowledgment of their difficult circumstances.",

Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

This is really just another step towards the dismantling of our democracy. First you break the law but tell everyone it is only the illegal criminals you are doing this to. But once you can break the law with impunity you can then start locking up others. It’s telling they used the Alien and Seditions act to do this. We all should have learned that this was an unconstitutional law when it first came out in 1789, which is why it was never used. Did you know this same law prevents criticizing the government as well? That’s where we are all heading and by the time you figure it out it will be too late.",

Hours earlier, the 26-year-old barber and dozens of other Venezuelan migrants at a federal detention facility in Texas were dressed in white clothes, handcuffed and taken onto a plane. He had no idea where he was going.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, Caraballo’s name disappeared from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s online detainee locator.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, Johanny Sánchez, learned Caraballo was among more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants flown over the weekend to El Salvador, where they are in a maximum-security prison after being accused by the Trump administration of belonging to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nSánchez insists her husband isn't a gang member. She struggles even to find logic in the accusation.\n\n<b>The weekend flights</b>\n\nFlights by U.S. immigration authorities set off a frantic scramble among terrified families after hundreds of immigrants vanished from ICE’s online locator.\n\nSome turned up at that massive El Salvador prison, where visitors, recreation and education are not allowed. The U.S. has paid El Salvador's government $6 million to hold immigrants, many of them Venezuelan, whose government rarely accepts deportees from the U.S.\n\nBut many families have no idea where to find their loved ones. El Salvador has no online database to look up inmates, and families there often struggle to get information.\n\n“I don’t know anything about my son,” said Xiomara Vizcaya, a 46-year-old Venezuelan.\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump announced he had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse, including rights to appear before an immigration or federal court judge.\n\nMany conservatives have cheered the deportations and the Trump administration for taking a hard stance on immigration.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has called the flights “kidnappings.” It urged its citizens living in the U.S. to return home and vowed get others back from El Salvador. But with diplomatic ties long broken between Venezuela and El Salvador, the prisoners have few advocates.\n\nThe U.S. deportations exacerbate Venezuela’s immigration crisis by turning “migrants into geopolitical pawns,” said Oscar Murillo, head of the Venezuelan human rights group Provea. \"There is a lack of transparency on the part of the U.S. and El Salvador regarding the status of deported individuals and the crimes for which they are being prosecuted.”\n\nSánchez is among those who believes the American dream has turned ugly. She wants to leave the U.S. once she finds her husband.\n\n“We fled Venezuela for a better future. We never imagined things would be worse.”",

No where does it say the any non citizen in this country can be deported to an El Salvador jail with no hearing whatsoever based in the whims of the government. This is really just another step towards the dismantling of our democracy. First you break the law but tell everyone it is only the illegal criminals you are doing this to. But once you can break the law with impunity you can then start locking up others. It’s telling they used the Alien and Seditions act to do this. We all should have learned that this was an unconstitutional law when it first came out in 1789, which is why it was never used. Did you know this same law prevents criticizing the government as well? That’s where we are all heading and by the time you figure it out it will be too late.",

National Guard and Reserve troops have until July 7.\n\nArmy Maj. Alivia Stehlik, who served in the infantry and is now a physical therapist, will be eligible to retire in three years but doesn’t want to be forced out for being a transgender service member.\n\n“I still have a job to do,” she said. “My command expects me to show up and be an officer and do my job because I’m the only person at my unit who can do what I do.”\n\nThe military services were rushing to put out new guidance to help commanders work through the process, including what to do in more complex situations, such as if any of the troops are deployed, at sea or may require special orders or funding to meet the deadlines.\n\nThere are about 2.1 million active duty, Guard and Reserve troops.\n\nAccording to the Defense Department, about 1,000 service members have voluntarily identified themselves as transgender and will now begin the process of leaving the military. And while the totals are early estimates, as many as 500 of those are Army soldiers, hundreds are in the Navy and at least 50 are Marines.",

If a person in the US military has shown the ability to do the job he/she was trained for it's absolutely ludicrous to force that person out. A lot of money was spent to train that individual and it's irrelevant what sexuality he/she is or identifies as and should not be a concern. People have been gay for thousands of years.

    "title": "Volunteers use bullhorns and sirens to warn immigrants when ICE is in their area",
    "summary": "The comments present a broad range of perspectives regarding immigration enforcement, particularly the actions of volunteers who warn undocumented immigrants of ICE operations. A majority of commenters express strong support for strict immigration control, advocating for the arrest and prosecution of those perceived to be aiding undocumented immigrants by warning them of ICE activities, viewing this as criminal conduct tantamount to obstruction of justice. Conversely, a minority of commentators argue for the compassion and rights of immigrants, suggesting that aiding those seeking better lives shouldn't be criminalized and is akin to exercising free speech.",

Bullhorns and sirens are ready for use. \n\n“There’s raza that’s been detained,” Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio's Los Angeles chapter, said before they split up in five cars. “It seems like there’s more activity now. Let’s keep a close eye out.” \n\nWorking with other similar-size groups and using walkie-talkies, the Community Self-Defense Coalition, made up of more than 60 organizations, found nothing Thursday but appeared to have disrupted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations earlier in the week. In Los Angeles and across the country, these tactics have been a thorn in ICE's side as it tries to carry out President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations. \n\nCounter-ICE operations have had “a huge impact,” said John Fabbricatore, a former head of ICE's enforcement and removal division in Denver. \n\n“It's dangerous for the officers because they are trying to get into a situation, maybe undercover, trying to make an arrest without alarming the neighborhood, and then these guys come out here with these bullhorns and they start yelling and screaming,” Fabbricatore said. \n\nAdvocates “go right to the edge” of a law against impeding federal law enforcement to avoid criminal prosecution, he said. \n\nAdvocates say they are exercising free speech and reminding people of their rights. ICE officers cannot forcibly enter a home without a judicial warrant, which they rarely have. Sophisticated “know-your- rights” campaigns urge people to stay inside and not open the door. \n\nBack at the parking lot about two hours after Thursday's mission started, the city was waking up. On the corner, a street vendor had set up her tamales stand. \n\n“We just got a report right now that all of our patrols happening in San Diego, Escondido, California; Los Angeles, California; South Gate and Alhambra, everything is all clear right now,” said Gochez, before heading to his day job as a high school history teacher.
